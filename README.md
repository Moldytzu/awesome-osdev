| | **Author(s):** Thomas Anderson and Michael Dahlin |
| | **Publication date:** August 21st, 2014 |
| | **Description:** Over the past two decades, there has been a huge amount of innovation in both the principles and practice of operating systems Over the same period, the core ideas in a modern operating system - protection, concurrency, virtualization, resource allocation, and reliable storage - have become widely applied throughout computer science. Whether you get a job at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or any other leading-edge technology company, it is impossible to build resilient, secure, and flexible computer systems without the ability to apply operating systems concepts in a variety of settings. This book examines the both the principles and practice of modern operating systems, taking important, high-level concepts all the way down to the level of working code. Because operating systems concepts are among the most difficult in computer science, this top to bottom approach is the only way to really understand and master this important material. |

|:-:|:--|
| | **Author(s):** Andrew S. Tannenbaum |
| | **Publication date:** December 1st, 1986 |
| | **Description:** From one of the Netherland's leading authors of computer science books comes complete coverage of operating systems, plus all the design and implementation issues with a complete operating system ‚Äî MINIX. |

|:-:|:--|
| | **Author(s):** Andrew S. Tannenbaum and Albert S. Woodhull |
| | **Publication date:** January 15th, 1997 |
| | **Description:** Most books on operating systems deal with theory while ignoring practice. While the usual principles are covered in detail, the book describes a small, but real UNIX-like operating system: MINIX. The book demonstrates how it works while illustrating the principles behind it. Operating Systems: Design and Implementation Second Edition provides the MINIX source code. The relevant selections of the MINIX code are described in detail. When it first came out, MINIX caused something of a revolution. Within weeks, it had its own newsgroup on USENET, with 40,000 people. Most wanted to make MINIX bigger and fancier. Instead, Linux was created. That has become quite popular, very large, and complicated. MINIX, on the other hand, has remained small and suitable for instruction and example. The book has been revised to include updates in MINIX, which started out as a v7 unix clone for a floppy-disk only 8088. It is now aimed at 386, 486, and pentium machines and is based on the international posix standard instead of on v7. There are now also versions of MINIX for the Macintosh and SPARC available. Professional programmers will find this book to be a valuable resource and reference. |

|:-:|:--|
| | **Author(s):** Andrew S. Tannenbaum and Albert S. Woodhull |
| | **Publication date:** January 4th, 2006 |
| | **Description:** Operating Systems Design and Implementation, 3e, is ideal for introductory courses on computer operating systems. Written by the creator of MINIX, professional programmers will now have the most up-to-date tutorial and reference available today. Revised to address the latest version of MINIX (MINIX 3), this streamlined, simplified new edition remains the only operating systems text to first explain relevant principles, then demonstrate their applications using a Unix-like operating system as a detailed example. It has been especially designed for high reliability, for use in embedded systems, and for ease of teaching.  |
